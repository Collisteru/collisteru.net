### Now

I graduated!

I am now in Berkeley CA doing [Inkhaven](https://www.inkhaven.blog/). I am publishing one blogpost a day on [my Substack blog.](https://collisteru.substack.com/).

## The Site

The domain is managed by ~~Squarespace~~ (Google Domains, eater of Squarespace), the site itself is hosted by Netlify, it's built largely in Gatsby, and the content is written in Markdown. KaTeX provides LaTeX rendering, and PrismJS provides code highlighting.

The design is inspired in part by late 90s / early 2000s web design and in part by 19th century typesetting. 

Design and inspiration-wise, the three biggest influences on this site were [Gwern Branwen](https://www.gwern.net/), [betaveros](https://beta.vero.site/), and [Mark Rosenfelder](https://zompist.com/). I also regularly take inspiration from the [LessWrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/) and [Slate Star Codex](https://slatestarcodex.com/) communities.

You can access the code [here](https://github.com/Collisteru/collisteru.net).
