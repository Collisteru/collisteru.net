# Now

I've graduated! I finished my senior thesis on the behavior of multi-agent systems, which you can read in the "software" tab.

I'm taking a gap year while applying to grad schools. I am working as a freelance software engineer.

From Oct 24th to Dec 18th, I will be staying in Berkeley. If you're in the Bay Area, email me and we can have a coffee chat!
