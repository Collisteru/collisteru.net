Welcome to Collisteru's little blog and portfolio site! Please enjoy your stay.

- **I'm a computer programmer, writer, and general creator.**
- Professionally, I'm a Computer Science + Applied Math undergraduate at the **University of Colorado.**  
- I work as an AI researcher in industry. **I think AI is the most important technology of the century** so far and am interested in making it safe and effective.

Right now this website is mostly dedicated to hosting writing and projects. You can read in [Writing](/writing) and [Software](/software).

## Contact

You can get in contact with me [here](../about). I'm always happy to hear from people who share my interests or who want to work on projects together. I'm also happy to help with any questions you have about the content on this site.
