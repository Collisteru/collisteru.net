Gain not base gains; base gains are the same as losses., Hesiod
"The boy called out 'Wolf, Wolf!' and the villagers came out to help him. A few days afterward he tried the same trick, and again they came to his help. Shortly after this a wolf actually came, but this time the villagers thought the boy was deceiving them again and nobody came to his help.", Aesop, The Shepherd's Boy

"I think that cars today are almost the exact equivalent of the great Gothic cathedrals. I mean the supreme creation of an era conceived with passion by unknown artists, and consumed in image if not in usage by a whole population which appropriates them as a purely magical object.", Roland Barthes, Mythologies [1972]
"Man should possess an infinite appetite for life. It should be self-evident to him, all the time, that life is superb, glorious, endlessly rich, infinitely desirable. At present, because he is in a midway position between the brute and the truly human, he is always getting bored, depressed, weary of life. He has become so top-heavy with civilisation that he cannot contact the springs of pure vitality.", Colin Wilson, "The Philosopher's Stone"
"Academical years ought by rights to give occupation to the whole mind. It is this time which, well or ill employed, affects a man's whole after-life",  Goethe
"At this point I'm going to tell you something you might not want to hear. It really matters to do well in your classes, even the ones that are just memorization or blathering about literature, because you need to do well in your classes to get into a good university. And if you want to start a startup you should try to get into the best university you can, because that's where the best cofounders are. It's also where the best employees are. When Larry and Sergey started Google, they began by just hiring all the smartest people they knew out of Stanford, and this was a real advantage for them. The empirical evidence is clear on this. If you look at where the largest numbers of successful startups come from, it's pretty much the same as the list of the most selective universities. I don't think it's the prestigious names of these universities that cause more good startups to come out of them. Nor do I think it's because the quality of the teaching is better. What's driving this is simply the difficulty of getting in. You have to be pretty smart and determined to get into MIT or Cambridge, so if you do manage to get in, you'll find the other students include a lot of smart and determined people.", Paul Graham, "How to Start Google"
"“It was shown in Section 2.1 that the real and the imaginary parts of an analytic function satisfy Laplace’s equation. This and the fact that the occurrence of Laplace’s equation in physics is ubiquitous constitute one of the main reasons for the usefulness of complex analysis in applications.", Fokas and Ablowitz, Complex Variables: Introduction and Applications

"If water is not piled up deep enough, it won’t have the strength to bear up a big boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor, and bits of trash will sail on it like boats. But set the cup there, and it will stick fast, for the water is too shallow and the boat too large. If wind is not piled up deep enough, it won’t have the strength to bear up great wings. Therefore when the Peng rises ninety thousand li, he must have the wind under him like that.", Description of Buoyance by Zhuangzi, Free and Easy Wandering
"The next real literary 'rebels' in this country might well emerge as some weird bunch of 'anti-rebels,' born oglers who dare to back away from ironic watching, who have the childish gall to actually endorse single-entendre values. Who treat old untrendy human troubles and emotions in U.S. life with reverence and conviction. Who eschew self-consciousness and fatigue. These anti-rebels would be outdated, of course, before they even started. Too sincere. Clearly repressed. Backward, quaint, naive, anachronistic. Maybe that'll be the point, why they'll be the next real rebels. Real rebels, as far as I can see, risk things. Risk disapproval. The old postmodern insurgents risked the gasp and squeal: shock, disgust, outrage, censorship, accusations of socialism, anarchism, nihilism. The new rebels might be the ones willing to risk the yawn, the rolled eyes, the cool smile, the nudged ribs, the parody of gifted ironists, the 'How banal.' Accusations of sentimentality, melodrama. Credulity. Willingness to be suckered by a world of lurkers and starers who fear gaze and ridicule above imprisonment without law. Who knows.", David Foster Wallace
"This was never a list for or about role-playing or role-playing games; we're elves. Deal with it, or not. It's up to you.", The Elfinkind Digest Landing Page, https://www.murkworks.net/~elflist/
"In the 1960s, when history and English majors were among the most popular on campus, America was a very different place. This was an America where most kids memorized reams of poetry in school, where one third of the country turned on their television to watch a live broadcast of *Richard III*, and where listening to speeches on American history was a standard Independence Day activity. … This was a world where the humanities mattered. So did humanities professors. They mattered in part, as traditionalists like to point out, because these professors were seen as the custodians of a cultural tradition to which most American intellectuals believed they were the heirs to. But they mattered for a more important reason—the reason intellectuals would care about that birthright in the first place. Americans once believed, *earnestly believed*, that by studying the words of Milton and Dante, or by examining the history of republican Rome or 16th century England, one could learn important, even eternal, truths about human nature and human polities. Art, literature, and history were a privileged source of insight into human affairs. In consequence, those well versed in history and the other humanistic disciplines had immense authority in the public eye. The man of vaulting ambition studied the humanities.", Tanner Greer, "THE FALL OF HISTORY AS A MAJOR–AND AS A PART OF THE HUMANITIES"
"Ornament becomes valuable when it is used to add beauty to common things, and to relieve the blankness of bare walls, floors, and ceilings.", W. Smith Williams (1863)
"I understand that travel in other nations is different from travel within the United States. Programs outside the United States can involve inconvenience and risk, including, but not limited to, forces of nature, geographic and climatic conditions, different hygienic standards, infrastructure problems (including road maintenance, transportation delays and accommodation conditions), civil unrest, vandalism, crime, political instability, and terrorism.", CIEE Study Abroad Contract
"On a final note, keep in mind that most people in the world will see you not as a political entity or an appendage of the Great Satan but as a guest to their country. Even if they vehemently disagree with your country's policies and practices, they will invariably honor your individuality and regard you with hospitality and respect. You'd never guess this by watching the evening news, of course, but travel allows you to experience the nuances of the world in a way that mass media never will.", Rolf Potts, Vagabonding
"The project of understanding the world lies at the bottom of who we are. Until we have pursued that project all the way, it is not just that we do not yet fully know what the desire to understand is a desire for, we do not yet know who we really are.", Jonathan Lear, Aristotle: The Desire to Understand
"It is the human genius for communication that makes languages work, not the inherent structure of a particular language, nor even its origins.", Humphrey Tonkin, Equalizing Language (1979)
"There is no longer any excuse why, even in the most elementary lessons — nay, I should say why more particularly in these elementary lessons— the dark and dreary passages of Greek and Latin, of French and German grammar, should not be brightened up by the electric light of Comparative Philology.", Max Müller
"The total amount of suffering per year in the natural world is beyond all decent contemplation. During the minute that it takes me to compose this sentence, thousands of animals are being eaten alive, many others are running for their lives, whimpering with fear, others are slowly being devoured from within by rasping parasites, thousands of all kinds are dying of starvation, thirst, and disease. It must be so. If there ever is a time of plenty, this very fact will automatically lead to an increase in the population until the natural state of starvation and misery is restored…. In a universe of electrons and selfish genes, blind physical forces and genetic replication, some people are going to get hurt, other people are going to get lucky, and you won’t find any rhyme or reason in it, nor any justice. The universe that we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but pitiless indifference", Richard Dawkins, River Out of Eden
"From all your herds, a cup or two of mill / From all your granaries, a loaf of bread / In all your palace, only half a bed: / Can man use more? And do you own the rest?", Ancient Sanskrit postmodern
"The act of working and being productive in American culture is in itself an affirmation of an individual’s worth. Americans take pride in what they do, and if they have to put up with adverse conditions to achieve their goals, they take additional pride in overcoming them: “We had to work around the clock and order in pizza at three in the morning, but the proposal looked great and we got the contract.” Such a comment from a French employee might sound to co-workers like a flimsy rationalization for aiding and abetting one’s own exploitation.", Au Contraire! Figuring out the French
"Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and that you have but one day to work in. And what of that? Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each hour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty seconds? Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.", Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo (Chapter 34)
"Hæc olim meminisse juvabit—It will be a joy to us to recall this, some day.", Virgil
"A man who is always asking 'Is what I do worth while?' and 'Am I the right person to do it?' will always be ineffective himself and a discouragement to others.", G.H. Hardy, A Mathematician's Apology
"We all want progress. But progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be. And if you have taken a wrong turning, then to go forward does not get you any nearer. If you are on the wrong road, progress means doing an about turn and walking back to the right road; and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man.", C.S. Lewis

"‘Gentlemen,’ he said, ‘—by which I mean, of course, latter adolescents who aspire to manhood—gentlemen, here is a truth: Enduring tedium over real time in a confined space is what real courage is. Such endurance is, as it happens, the distillate of what is, today, in this world neither I nor you have made, heroism. Heroism.’ He made a point of looking around, gauging people’s reaction. Nobody laughed; a few looked puzzled. I remember I was starting to have to go to the bathroom. In the classroom’s fluorescent lights, he cast no shadow on any side. ‘By which,’ he said, ‘I mean true heroism, not heroism as you might know it from films or the tales of childhood. You are now nearly at childhood’s end; you are ready for the truth’s weight, to bear it. The truth is that the heroism of your childhood entertainments was not true valor. It was theater. The grand gesture, the moment of choice, the mortal danger, the external foe, the climactic battle whose outcome resolves all—all designed to appear heroic, to excite and gratify an audience. An audience.’ He made a gesture I can’t describe: ‘Gentlemen, welcome to the world of reality—there is no audience. No one to applaud, to admire. No one to see you. Do you understand? Here is the truth—actual heroism receives no ovation, entertains no one. No one queues up to see it. No one is interested.’", David Foster Wallace, The Pale King (Chapter 22)

"And also, admittedly, for esthetic value. One earns the right to add ‘extraneous’ details by first putting in the hard work of removing the actual extraneous details; only after the ground has been cleared—the ‘data-ink ratio’ maximized, the ‘chartjunk’ removed—can one see what is actually beautiful to add.", Gwern
"A final word: when we do not understand something, it does not look like there is anything to be understood at all - it just looks like random noise. Just because it looks like noise does not mean there is no hidden structure.", johnwentsworth, Book Review: Design Principles of Biological Circuits (LessWrong)
"To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts, nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically. The success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success, not kingly, not manly.", Thoreau, Walden
"Yet not the less, in my case, did I think it worth my while to weave them, and instead of studying how to make it worth men's while to buy my baskets, I studied rather how to avoid the necessity of selling them. The life which men praise and regard as successful is but one kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the expense of the others?", Thoreau, Walden
"The very simplicity and nakedness of man's life in the primitive ages imply this advantage, at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep, he contemplated his journey again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and was either threading the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing the mountain-tops.", Thoreau, Walden
"Why is the great number of hard-working, innocent men who till the land every day of the year that you may eat all its fruits, scorned, vilified, oppressed, robbed; and why is it that the useless and often very wicked man who lives only by their work, and who is rich only through their poverty, is on the contrary respected, courted, considered?", Voltaire, Philosophical Dictionary

"I believe in aristocracy, though — if that is the right word, and if a democrat may use it. Not an aristocracy of power, based upon rank and influence, but an aristocracy of the sensitive, the considerate and the plucky. Its members are to be found in all nations and classes, and all through the ages, and there is a secret understanding between them when they meet. They represent the true human tradition, the one permanent victory of our queer race over cruelty and chaos. Thousands of them perish in obscurity, a few are great names. They are sensitive for others as well as for themselves, they are considerate without being fussy, their pluck is not swankiness but the power to endure, and they can take a joke.", E.M.Forster, "What I Believe" - Two Cheers for Democracy
"It is like swimming. If you can’t swim, you won’t be having any fun at all. Swimming sucks if all you do is float (or even sink) and fight the water. But boy, if you figure out the technique and glide through the water, it is incredible. But you don’t learn swimming by aiming for ease and fun. You learn to swim by aiming to be fast and graceful", zwettelkasten.de
"Everyone holds his fortune in his own hand, like a sculptor the raw material he will fashion into a figure. But it's the same with that type of artistic activity as with all others: We are merely born with the capbaility to do it. The skill to mold the material into what we want must be learned and attentively cultivated.", Johanne Wolfgang von Goethe
"Many mathematical objects can be understood better by breaking them into constituent parts, or finding some properties of them that are universal, not caused by the way we choose to represent them.", Ian Goodfellow, Deep Learnign
"I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who make things beautiful. Amor fati: let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: someday I wish to be only a Yes-sayer.", Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science
"He who cannot draw on three thousand years of history is living from hand to mouth, Goethe
"So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change. This is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as there can be drawn radii from one centre.", Thoreau, Walden
" (2024_03_27 - from mandy) got any thoughts on 'so bad it's good' stuff? (games, movies, music, etc)* --- (Emma Essex): i don't really subscribe to the idea, i think mainly because they rely heavily on a shared idea of bad/good/etc, which most of the time i don't share. a lot of 'so bad it's good' also tends to focus on work made under strenuous condition or by people that haven't mastered their craft, and i think in those cases it's a lot better to admire that the thing exists the way it does. amateur charm and enjoyable jank tend to be a much healthier outlook on that, since they are so much more realistic - somebody being new to a form of art is normal, and things not reaching their full potential for any number of reasons is normal. from those normals, an unintended layer of enjoyment is created; not because it's bad, but usually because it's surprising. if something is 'so bad it's good,' it was never bad to you.*", Emma Essex via Slowchat (March 2024)
